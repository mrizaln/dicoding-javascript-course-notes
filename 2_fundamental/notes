variable declaration:
    var     function scope      -           unrecommended use
    let     block scope         mutable
    const   block scope         immutable   

data types: 
    undefined       uninitialized variable
    numbers         floating point      -2^53 to 2^53-1
    BigInt          integral            add 'n' character at end of number to defferentiate numbers with bigint
    string          string              use ' or " (no difference)
                    string interpolation using `; like f-string in python3.10 but using ${var_name}
    boolean         boolean
                            falsy       0
                                        0n
                                        "" '' (empty string)
                                        null
                                        undefined
                                        NaN
                            truthy      [[except above]]
    null            something like nullptr (C/C++) or None (python3)
    symbol          new (ES6)
                    used to show as unique identifier

type conversion:
    javascript ALWAYS implicitly converts type

operators:
    = += -= *= /= %=            assignment
    > < >= <= == != === !==     comparison (== compare value (remember the automatic type conversion), === compare object (data type))
    && || !                     logical
    & | ^ ~ << >> >>>           bitwise operator (>> vs >>>: ...) [bitwise done in 32 bit]

control flow:
    if-else         branch              [[ same as in C ]]
    switch case     branch (simple)     [[ same as in C ]]
    for             loop                [[ same as in C ]]
    for of          loop                similar to ```for (auto& i : array_like_container)```
    while           loop                [[ same as in C ]]
    do-while        loop                [[ same as in C ]]
