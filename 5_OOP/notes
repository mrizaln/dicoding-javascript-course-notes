class:
    a blueprint
    two ways: - function syntax
                    has something like prototype: don't copy attribute to every instantiated object
              - class syntax
    class has a dynamic property (like python; property can be added or removed after definition)
    private variable is prefixed with an underscore (_) (just a convention)
                                      a  hash sign  (#) (not supported on older engine)
    static method is prefixed with [static] keyword


inheritance:
    use [extends] keyword
    ``` class ChildClass extends ParentClass{}; ```

    use [super(...params)] to call parent constructor


overriding:
    yeah, like overriding a member function in C++

    use [super.overriddenFunction(...)] to call overriddenFunction of Parent class from Child class


object composition:
    idk


built-in class:
    Date, Object, Array, Math, String
